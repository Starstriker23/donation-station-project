# The Donation Station Project
This project is meant to be an outline for a shopping web application with the concept that all items sold were previously donated by post-secondary students, and are now being sold at a reduced price.
The application offers features such as a save for later button, user profiles, and a "sort by" for item results.
Clicking on the item's takes you to their page with more information available, as well as more images for reference.
I am well aware there are some missing intricacies with this application, but this was mainly used as a proof of concept.
My main goal with this application was to create an accessible and functional site with core UI/UX principles in mind.
